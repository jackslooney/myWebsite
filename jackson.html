                       From the start, Ookla has always been an outcast. As the son of the village healer, 
                       he had little status in a social ladder based on physical prowess. However, as Ookla developed and become an Orcish teen,
                       it became clear that he was blessed with a warrior's body, rather than the meek body of healer (along with the brains of one).
                       Because of the nature of predjudice, Ookla was still scorned by both man and orc alike. This made him grow up fast, with all of the skills
                       to survive in the wild, as he wasn't allowed to interact with the "normal villagers".
                       One day, he came back to his mother's hut to see the village chief standing over his mother's broken body.
                       Using his superior combat ability, he bested the chief in honorable combat, but, even though it was a legal bout,
                       he was chased out of the village, and is hunted by the village warriors to this day. So far, Ookla's superior survival and combat skills 
                       has allowed him to stay a few steps ahead of them, but who knows how long that will last...

                    Ookla's main quality is his indominable strength. He has no trouble with almost anything strength based.
                    Need someone to tow a whole sledful of people? He's your man! Need to throw a party member over 100 feet 
                    for a contest? No problem.

                    Ookla, being from a relatively small orcish village, doesn't speak common, and as a result sometimes has 
                    a hard time communicating with others. He may come off as unintelligent, but don't be fooled, he is no simpleton.
                    When talking through an interpreter, he can be very refined.
