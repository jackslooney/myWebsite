            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>Was born into slavery at a mining town. He was forced to work once he turn 5 and able to be used. 
                Worked a life of mining and slavery until he is 20. His only remaining parent, his mother, collapses and gets sick. 
                Trying to help his mother, he disobeys orders resulting in punishments and extra time in the mines. 
                After 3 days without rest in the mines as punishment, he finds out his mother was killed due to uselessness to the owner. 
                He snaps and tries to kill one of the guards. Deemed to be unnecessary by the owner for insubordination,
                 he gets sold to a Kenku artifact collector for his bones. Before being killed in a ritual sacrifice, 
                 he overpowers the collector and kills him. He decides to stay in the camp of the collector and live there with the
                  remaining supplies. Once the supplies run out, he decides to leave, taking with him some of the artifacts the collector
                   had acquired including a Oni mask and twin daggers. Not having any means of earning money and no experience interacting 
                   with people, he took to stealing to survived. He slowly learned how to manipulate people and operate out of the darkness. 
                   He used the fact that he had no identity to pose as the collector, imitating his voice, to sell stolen items that were of 
                   no use to him or earn some money to buy things that were to risky to steal, but were necessary. 5 years later, he gets a bit
                    to ambitious in trying to make money. He gets caught trying to steal a relic from an old mage. The mage doesnâ€™t care for that 
                    and decides to banish him with a teleportation spell to a place known for criminal activity. Eventually meets with rest of party.
