            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>He was born into a mining company in The Plain of Standing Stones. Due to his rebellious actions,
                he was sold to a merchant to be using in a ritual. Not wanting to be killed, he kills the merchant and escapes.
                This leads him to lead a life of crimes, stealing to survive. Making a very daring move, he tries to steal a magical 
                artifact from a mage and gets caught. The mage decides to send him to the most barren wastland he could think of, being Icewind Dale.
            </p>
            <h1>Talents</h1>
            <p>Seran being a Kenku, has a certain knack for manipulation. He is able to mimic the voices of those he has heard as well as copy
                 their writing. He likes to keep to the shadows as much as possible.<br>
                <br>
               Among the things that have happen to Seran, one of the most jarring is a sudden case of vampirism. He was transformed into a vampire
                and thus lost his humanity. The cost brought the ability to take teh life force of anything that he attacks as well as regenerative abilities.

            <h2>Phantom Arm</h2>
            <p>This gift from the god Gond restored Seran's missing arm along with other perks. Seran's reach is not up to ten feet
                 allowing him to keep a safe distance while still dealing damage. The arm is also able to be taken off and controlled remotely
                  as a mage hand.
            </p>
            <h2>Bladed Fingers</h2>
            <p>Upon becoming a vampire, Seran aquired the ability to do significantly more damage without the use of a weapon. Unarmed strike
                is now based on Dexterity instead of Strength and as a bonus action heals Seran for a number of hit points. Upon crit, the
                attacked creature is dealt an extra 1/2 the damage in necrotic. This damage gets dealed each turn that the creature fails a 
                Medicine check.
