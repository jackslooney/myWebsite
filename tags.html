<!--
    In the tags.html file, have each group member use 10 different tags from this list
     with about two different tag types from each category to create a wide variety of different html elements.  
     Donâ€™t forget to start this file and the others with basic webpage html elements in the appropriate places like this:  
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
