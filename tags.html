            <h1>Our history of betting</h1>
            <p>When entering <strong>Bryn Shander</strong>, our party was met with a young artificier, He decided to try and
                take one of our party members, which we tried to stop. This then leads to a bet, if we won we got to keep
                our party member. <br>
                Unforunatly, we would also be losing a differnt party member if we one. The bet was a contest of strength
                so Ookla was the one to participate. The contest was who could through Seran the farthest. Ookla channeled all his energy and threw Seran
                a whopping 80 ft across the city. Long story short Ookla won the bet and Seran was given over to Matty to experiment on. These experiments would 
                eventually lead to the lose of Seran's arm.<br></p>
                <br>
                <h4>Our second Bet</h4>
                <p>Upon returning to the city we waged another bet, this time between two party members. The goal was for one to attack the other and
                 still be able to stand after the attack. Ookla in his infinite wisdom gathered a crown of people and started taking bets on who would 
                  win. Ignom uses his most powerful attack at Stadler and fires. Stadler being able to change his form at will was able to absorb the attack and
                   thus remained standing. This exchange brought in quite a bit of capitol due to the amount of people betting. The amount of money aquired are as such:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ookla: <i>MUCH</i></li>
                <li>Ivory: Not as much</li>
                <li>Seran: 10 gold (from stealing) </li>
                <li>Stadler: 0 gold</li>
                <li>Ignom: 0 gold</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Starting Our Journey</h2>
            <p>Our individual party members found themselves trapped in a frozen wasteland due to various cercumstances. 
                The party started by meeting in a little town known as <!--J--><b><a href="./index.html">Bremen</a></b>, and shortly after meeting, the party was given a glorified
                fetch quest to go catch what is known as a Chwinga. During this quest, the party had to cross multiple frozen rivers, which resulted in most of the party being 
                dropped into the icy waters.This is where our parties fear of rivers began. After this quest was completed, and a small amount of money gained, 
                the party set off together in search of more adventure...

            <h2>A Summary of Events Leading to Present Time</h2>
            <p>
                The party found themselves in Targos (the only town that connects to Bremen by road), and ended up offering to help a townsperson in need. This man's husband
                had gone off on an expidition to a local mountain range called Kelvin's Cairn, and hadn't returned for some time. The party offered to find him, for almost no
                 cost whatsoever. During this rescue mission, the party met multiple notable people, including an accomplished (and a little crazy) arficier named Matty. Matty 
                 unethically kidnaps and experiments on Seran, then offers Ivory an apprenticeship. <br> A notable quote from Matty: </p>
                <!--J-->
                 <blockquote>I'm just gunna take him for my
                    experiments, if you try to stop me, I kill you. <br>
                    - Matty
                </blockquote>

                 <p>From here the party: </p>
                 <!--J-->
                 <ul>
                     <li>Explores further East</li>
                     <li>Eats some incredible chowder</li>
                     <li>Rescues, and returns the husband</li>
                 </ul>
            <p>
                    After this, the party gains items, strange attributes, and other abilities. Matty further experiements on Seran, and turns him into an undead vampire. 
                This creates Some problems. In Easthaven, the half the party accidentally <s>assaults a doctor</s>, and then convinces him it didn't happen, 
                while the other half committs murder most foul.
                It can be assumed that the party would rather not go back to Easthaven after such crimes. <br> <br>
                    The party then heads to Lonelywood, the home of Ignum, who lives with
                his grandmother. His grandmother turns out to be a demon, and kills basically everyone in the town, as well as a member of the party, Ivory. Distrought, Ookla walks 
                multiple days and nights to Bryn Shander to bring Ivory to Matty, in hopes he can be resurrected. Matty extracts Ivory's soul and places it into a metal housing, essentially
                turning Ivory from Elvish, to Warforged. As payment, Matty charges the party with bringing down a corrupt, evil city of artificiers, <b><a href="./Images/currentmap.png">Argona</a></b>.
                The party agrees, without knowing what they are getting into. Upon arriving to the city, they realize that this city is <b>Colossal</b>, with perhaps <i>millions of inhabitants</i>.
                <br>
                The party is forced to consider another way, as killing millions of innocents really wasn't in the job description. They come up with a plan, but must find jobs, and gather
                information before they can make any hardline decisiions.

            <p>Papa Charles was kind enough to give Ookla a job as a bouncer as well as a room in the tavern. Ookla's
                size and strength sure does make him fit.
                Upon entering the Tavern, Zohe walked up to the shadiest looking person in the place and asked for work
                to make money so she may buy a clockwork puppy. This guy was...not so impressed by her skills, or lack
                thereof. He however decided to accept her help anyways, or potentially sell her body for parts, it is
                unclear yet. Seran followed Zohe in meeting this man and will also potentialy be sold off to the highest
                bidder.
            </p>
            <p>Ignum and Stadler are going to go along to the Office of Exchange in an attempt to get a job. And that
                was where the session ended.</p>

        <div class="col-5">
            <h2>Last Session</h2>
            <p>After having defeated Krampus as per Matty's request, the group heads over to Argona. This is the
                final task the group has to complete in order to
                be free of Matty's debt. This city is a floating city that flies way above the clouds, held up by four
                large propellers. This city used to worship Gond, Matty's deity, but has since turned to worship (Evil
                snow bitch). In addition to worshipping (evil snow bitch)
                the older population is quite racist, howver the younger generation is trying to turn around. Due to the
                people in this city being racist and not worshiping Gond,
                Matty requested we drop the city and kill everyone in it. Our group had several issues with this task.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not fully trust Matty, so how can we take his word as true?</li>
                <li>Just because a city has some racist people, does that justify the murders?</li>
                <li>Why should we drop a city due to their religion?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After we made our way up the city our first task was to find out some information. We made our way
                through Skald Park towards the railway, where we spotted some guards. We knew after spotting them we
                didn't want to draw attention to ourselves. We took the railway to Leighlines before making our way to
                Cabriole.
                There we stumbled across a tavern with the most groovy owner, Papa Charles.</p>
